This is the Blister library, a Java library available under the Apache License (v2.0) for 
manipulating Apple's Binary Plist format. It can deserialize a byte array to produce a
navigable tree of BPItems representing the plist, and it can take a tree of items and
serialize them into a byte array.
</p>
<p>
Warning: this library is known to be incomplete - currently it doesn't implement the 
floating-point or date types. Also, there are potentially issues with signed / unsigned
values which need to be documented or worked around. In particular, it doesn't represent
the full range of long values which can be represented in a plist (i.e. the values between
2^63 and 2^64-1 which can be stored in an unsigned long in C, but can't be represented in
Java).
